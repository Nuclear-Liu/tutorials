# Ideal Use Case for Lambda Expressions _Lambda 表达式典型案例_

Suppose that you are creating a social networking application. 
You want to create a feature that enables an administrator to perform any kind of action, such as sending a message, on members of the social networking application that satisfy certain criteria. 
The following table describes this use case in detail:

| Field                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                    | Perform action on selected members                                                                                                                                                        |
| Primary Actor           | Administrator                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Preconditions           | Administrator is logged in to the system                                                                                                                                                  |
| Postconditions          | Action is performed only on members that fit the specified criteria                                                                                                                       |
| Main Success Scenario   |                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Extensions              | 1a. Administrator has an option to preview those members who match the specified criteria before he or she specifies the action to be performed or before selecting the **Submit** button |
| Frequency of Occurrence | Many times during the day                                                                                                                                                                 |
