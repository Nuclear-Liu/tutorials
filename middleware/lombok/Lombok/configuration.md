# Configuration system


> Lombok, made to order: Configure lombok features in one place for your entire project or even your workspace.


The configuration system was introduced in lombok 1.14. <br/>
The import directive was added in lombok 1.18.12. <br/>
The lombok.addNullAnnotations configuration key was added in lombok 1.18.12.


## Overview

You can create `lombok.config` files in any directory and put configuration directives in it. 
These apply to all source files in this directory and all child directories.

The configuration system is particularly useful for configurable aspects of lombok which tend to be the same across an entire project, such as the name of your log variable. 
The configuration system can also be used to tell lombok to flag any usage of some lombok feature you don't like as a warning or even an error.

Usually, a user of lombok puts a `lombok.config` file with their preferences in a workspace or project root directory, with the special `config.stopBubbling = true` key to tell lombok this is your root directory. 
You can then create `lombok.config` files in any subdirectories (generally representing projects or source packages) with different settings.

An up to date list of all configuration keys supported by your version of lombok can be generated by running:

```shell
java -jar lombok.jar config -g --verbose
```

The output of the config tool is itself a valid `lombok.config` file.
The config tool can also be used to display the complete lombok configuration used for any given directory or source file by supplying these as arguments.
A sample of available configuration options (see the feature pages of the lombok features for their related config keys, as well as `java -jar lombok.jar config -g` for the complete list):

`lombok.accessors.chain`
If set to `true`, generated setters will 'chain' by default (They will return this instead of having a void return type).

`lombok.accessors.fluent`
If set to `true`, generated setters and getters will simply be named the same as the field name, without a get or set prefix.

`lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties`
If true, lombok will generate a @java.beans.ConstructorProperties annotation when generating constructors. Note that you'll need to depend on module 'java.desktop' if you're using jigsaw.

`lombok.log.fieldName`
The name of the generated log field (default: `log`).

`lombok.(featureName).flagUsage`
Allows you to forcibly stop or discourage use of a lombok feature. Legal values for this key are warning or error. Some examples of values for (featureName) are: "experimental" (flags use of any of the experimental features), "builder", "sneakyThrows", or "extensionMethod".

Configuration files are hierarchical: 
Any configuration setting applies to all source files in that directory, and all source files in subdirectories, but configuration settings closer to the source file take precedence. 
For example, if you have in `/Users/me/projects/lombok.config` the following:

```lombok.config
lombok.log.fieldName = foobar
```

and in `/Users/me/projects/MyProject/lombok.config` you have:

```lombok.config
lombok.log.fieldName = xyzzy
```

Then the various `@Log` annotations will use `foobar` instead of the default `log` as a field name to generate in all your projects, except for your project in `/Users/me/projects/MyProject`, where `xyzzy` is used instead.

To restore a configuration key set by a parent config file back to the default, the `clear` option can be used. 
For example, if a parent configuration file has configured all use of `val` to emit a warning, you can turn off the warnings for a subdirectory by including in it a `lombok.config` file with:

```lombok.config
clear lombok.val.flagUsage
```

Some configuration keys take lists. 
For lists, use `+=` to add an entry. 
You can remove a single item from the list (useful to undo a parent configuration file's setting) with `-=`. 
For example:

```lombok.config
lombok.accessors.prefix += m_
```

Comments can be included in `lombok.config` files; any line that starts with `#` is considered a comment.

## Global config keys

These configuration keys have an effect on many or all lombok features, or on the configuration system itself.

To stop lombok from looking at parent directories for more configuration files, the special key:

```lombok.config
config.stopBubbling = true
```

can be included. We suggest you put this in the root of your workspace directory.

Lombok can add nullity annotations (usually called `@NonNull` and `@Nullable`) whenever it makes sense to do so; think of generated `toString` and [`withX` methods (these never return null), or the parameter of a generated `equals`]() method, which is allowed to be null, and requires such an annotation if you've set up your IDE for strict null checks as well as 'parameters are non-null by default'. 
There are many such libraries; you must tell lombok which one to use. By default, no such annotations are added. Enable this feature with:

```lombok.config
lombok.addNullAnnotations = <flavor>
```

Many flavors are available: `javax` (=JSR305; not recommended), `eclipse`, `jetbrains`, `netbeans`, `androidx`, `android.support` (deprecated within android), `checkerframework` (recommended), `findbugs`, `spring`, `jml`, or define your own via `CUSTOM:fully.qualified.NonNullAnnotation:fully.qualified.NullableAnnotation`; if your nullity annotation is solely of the type use style (it annotates types, such as eclipse's and checkerframework's offerings, versus annotating methods and parameters), the format is `CUSTOM:TYPE_USE:nonnullanno:nullableanno`.

This feature was added in lombok v1.18.12.

Lombok can be configured to add `@lombok.Generated` annotations to all generated nodes where possible; useful for JaCoCo (which has built in support), or other style checkers and code coverage tools:

```lombok.config
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
```

Lombok can add the `@SuppressFBWarnings` annotation which is useful if you want to run `FindBugs` on your class files. 
To enable this feature, make sure findbugs is on the classpath when you compile, and add the following config key:

```lombok.config
lombok.extern.findbugs.addSuppressFBWarnings = true
```

Lombok adds the `@SuppressWarnings("all")` annotation to all generated nodes by default. 
This can be turned off which is useful if you want to use static code analyzers like [Checker Framework]().

```lombok.config
lombok.addSuppressWarnings = false
```
