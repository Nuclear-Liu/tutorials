## Equality Comparison

Since its inception, dbUnit has had equality comparison for expected vs actual data results. 
It enables comparing actual table results to expected results in an equal manner.

The [Assertion]() and [DbUnitAssert]() classes have `assertEquals()` methods for the equality comparisons.
